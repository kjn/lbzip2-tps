lbzip2 decompression test based on
PROTOS Genome Test Suite c10-archive
http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c10/archive/

PROTOS Genome Test Suite c10-archive contains 321,818 test cases for
bz2 decompression, which are used to test correctness of lbzip2
decompression code.

Each test case has a unique ID, which is MD5 hash of bz2 payload.
Test cases which payloads are expected to decompress successfully have
content hash, which is MD5 hash of decompressed payload.  Test cases
which are expected not to decompress correctly have no content ID.

To run the tests a binary file containing test data is required.  It
can be downloaded from:

    http://archive.lbzip2.org/protos/blob.bz2

This file is compressed with lbzip2 and has to be decompressed before
running tests.

Test data is free software and it is available under the same terms as
other files (GNU GPL).  Source code can be downloaded from:
